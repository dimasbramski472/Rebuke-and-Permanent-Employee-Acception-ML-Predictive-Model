    "\n",
    "* `pandas` is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `NumPy` which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Matplotlib` is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Seaborn` has a similar function to Matplotlib. It provides higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics than Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Warnings` Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesn’t warrant raising an exception and terminating the program."

    "For evaluation of model performance, each algorithm has different metrics. The simplest metric to check model performance is accuracy. However, in many real problems, accuracy alone is not enough. Another method used is the Confusion Matrix. The Confusion Matrix represents the comparison of predictions and real LABELs from the test dataset generated by the ML algorithm. Here's the template for the Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "`True Positive (TP)`: If it is predicted to be rebuked (Positive), and true to be rebuked (Positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "`True Negative (TN)`: If it is predicted not to be rebuked (Negative) and actually not to be rebuked (Negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "`False Positive (FP)`: If it is predicted to be rebuked (Positive), but it turns out that it is not actually rebuked (Negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "`False Negative (FN)`: If it is predicted that you will not get a rebuke (Negative), but it turns out that you actually get a rebuke (Positive).\n",
